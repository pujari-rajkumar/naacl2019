Newtons law had a huge impact on how people thought about the universe
Had a huge impace on how people thought about the universe
It added to communication
It explained gravity
Affected the way people thought about the world
Means gravity affects all objects in the universe
It includes motion of all things
Because it affects nothing
Because it affects everything
It includes solar energy
Newton was the first to suggest that gravity affects all objects in the universe
It is the center of the universe
All happens due to lack of gravity
Your both lacking energy
All happens due to outside forces
Because you both have polarity
You both are conductors
Universal gravitation means that all objects are affected by gravity in the same way
They are the same in the way that they are affected by gravity since all objects are affected by gravity in the same way
Because there is gravity all around you
Gravity is universal . That means gravity affects all objects in the universe
Because it is about exertion
Because it deals with the motion of objects
That means gravity affects all objects in the universe
Newton was the first one to suggest that gravity is universal

A legendary longneck who once protected the Great Valley from the most ferocious sharptooth ever to live . A fight ensued , which led to the Sharptooth 's death . a huge monolith that resembled a proud sauropod , having life - sized Sharptooth teeth arranged around his neck , came out of the ground during an earthquake
It looks like a giant long neck tail

Speed = distance motion
Speed = time motion
With a scientific formula
How many miles you traveled and when you arrived
To determine the cars speed you would need both the distance traveled and the time it took to travel that distance
How many meter you drove
How far you went and the number of seconds it took
How far you traveled and how long it took you
How many miles did you drive
How long did it take
Ohms - Scientists
The SI unit is meters per second ( m / s ) . Used by scientists
KPH - US
Frequency - Kinetic Engineers
H is used by the US
Scientist use m
US use mi
km
SI- scientists
S
How long it takes to travel that far
Speed = distance time
Using a speedometer
Multiplying distance by time
How far something travels
Speed can be calculated using this formula : speed = distance time A familiar example is the speed of a car
Multiplying miles by the time
Speed = 120 mi = 40 mi
120 times three
120 times 40
120 divided by 40 no unit
Speed = 40 mi / h 3h
H 3h
120 divided by three miles per hour
Speed = 121 mi = 40 mi

The melted pieces
The LEGO parts
The mess that your sister made
A mix - up of items of different size , shape or other characteristics
The different size and shape of LEGO parts
The LEGOs melting in the fireplace
The chemical change from the melting LEGOs
Fortunately , it was a physical change and she just made a simple mixture so you are able to separate them back into order
Because they were seperated by colors
Only some of them were mixed up
Because they have different shapes and sizes
Because they were n't melted
A physical change
A chemical change from the melting LEGO parts
A simple change
It would have been a chemical change , because they would have melted together

A chemical change
Chemicals were mixed together
Different shapes and sizes were mixed together
Different colors were mixed together
It was a physical change , and you 'll be able to put them back in order
They will need to be thrown in the fireplace
They create a simple mixture
They 'll need sorting back into place
You have to put them all back into the original categories by sorting them by size and shape until they are each back into their specific place in the tray
They become melted
Making a chemical change with the LEGOS
Putting them back into their original categories
To put in categories
Seperating them and putting them back in order
Making a mixture with the LEGOs
In case you need them for your next project
You have a project due tomorrow
You need them for a project

Your sister mixed them together
You dropped them near the fireplace
They were mixed together
Your younger sister mixed them all up
You mixed them together
The melting LEGO pieces

To blow the candle out
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work
The evening of the attack

Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on

Wine maker

He had n't been there since the evening of the attack
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar

Midnight
When he finished searching the cellar
At break of dawn
When he entered the cellar
Just as the day was breaking
Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on

That morning
A week ago
The evening of the attack
Early in the morning
He 'd never been there
The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack
Just before searching the ground floor
The night of the attack
Reading
Sleeping
Searching
Making his rounds
Cooking
Looking for the key to the cellar
Cleaning
The ground floor
The study
The cellars
Outside
The house
He had n't been there since the evening of the attack
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work

Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work
The evening of the attack
The morning of the attack

Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on

He had n't been there since the evening of the attack

Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost

Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear

Bed time
Midnight
When he finished searching the cellar
At break of dawn
When he entered the cellar
Just as the day was breaking
Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on
A teacher

That morning
A week ago
The evening of the attack
Early in the morning
He 'd never been there
The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack
Just before searching the ground floor
The night of the attack
Reading
Sleeping
Searching
Making his rounds
Cooking
Looking for the key to the cellar
Cleaning
The ground floor
The study
The cellars
Outside
The house
He had n't been there since the evening of the attack
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious

Making his rounds
Cooking
Looking for the key to the cellar
Cleaning
The ground floor
The study
The cellars
Outside
The house
He had n't been there since the evening of the attack
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work

It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work
The evening of the attack
The morning of the attack
A few years ago
The day after the attack

Bed time
Midnight
When he finished searching the cellar
At break of dawn
When he entered the cellar
Just as the day was breaking
Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on

The evening of the attack

The house
He had n't been there since the evening of the attack
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light

Bed time
Midnight
When he finished searching the cellar
At break of dawn
When he entered the cellar
Just as the day was breaking
Early morning
Around noon
Had uneventful search
In the cellar
At bed time
Found nothing
As the day was just breaking
Thought they finished searching
They found something interesting
The candle got too small
After finishing rounds of the ground floor
The light came back on
A teacher
A prince
A policeman
A keeper
Wine maker

Guard
Security guard
A philosopher
That morning
A week ago
The evening of the attack
Early in the morning
He 'd never been there
The last time he went there was on the evening of the attack
Just before searching the ground floor
The night of the attack
Reading
Sleeping
Searching
Making his rounds
Cooking
Looking for the key to the cellar
Cleaning
The ground floor
The study
The cellars
Outside
The house
Cause he heard some sounds in the cellar
Cause he extinguished the candle but does n't need one in the cellar
It had never been searched
It had not been searched since the attack and not doing so would smack of sheer cowardice
It had not been searched since the night of the attack
Anyone and anything could get inside
Never been to the cellar before
It is scary
There are bats
Cause it 's huge and dark and gloomy
It is warm
It is dark
Cause it 's been searched already
Of all the rooms it 's the gloomiest , weirdest , and devoid of daylight
The key to the cellar is lost
To blow the candle out
Not going into the cellar
Extinguishing the candle
Shirking the responsibility of checking the cellars
Going into the cellar
Searching the ground floor
He heard a sound
It 's huge and weird
He thought it was dark and dangerous
It 's dark , unlit by a ray of daylight
He 'd been told there is a ghost living there
It 's where the attack happened
It was dark and gloomy
It was cavernous
He was sick
It was cold
It 's huge and weird
He hesitated because he had not been down there since the night of the attack
He was sleepy
He has never been to the cellar
It scares him
He had already been to the cellar that evening
It is dark , unlit by any ray of light
Sheds
The study and his room
The cellars
Studies
The rooms in the house
The surrounding houses
To see what wines were available , to unlock the door
The attack happened there and he loved the cellars
To come across something dangerous , to look for his key
He heard a sound and thought someone was there
The cellars are the most unlikely places to come across something dangerous , and he was n't a coward anyway
To not shirk work , to not smack of sheer cowardice
one . Not searching the cellars would be cowardly . two . The cellars are locked and the person has the key , making them relatively safe from intruders
It would be cowardly and the cellars quite safe
The cellars were the most likely place for something or someone to hide in and he was too curious
Going to the tower
To not search the cellar
To not do rounds of the ground floor
Extinguishing the candle
Not going to the cellar out of fear
Not searching the ground floor
Shirking the work
The evening of the attack
The morning of the attack

The strength of gravity is the same despite the range
The closer the object , the stronger weaker the gravity
Gravity works over vast distances
Gravity can act over large distances , but gets weaker the farther apart the objects are
The further away the object , the weaker the gravity
The further away the object , the stronger the gravity
