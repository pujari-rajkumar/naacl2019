The difference is in lenght
Sometimes a full Moon moves through Earths shadow
Total- the moon travels completely in Earth 's umbra , partial- only a portion of the moon enters the Earth 's umbra
During a total lunar eclipse , the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra , and only a portion does during the partial lunar eclipse
The difference is in lenght
Sometimes a full Moon moves through Earths shadow
Whether the moon completely or partially enters the earth 's umbra
During a total lunar eclipse , the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra , and only a portion does during the partial lunar eclipse

The waning moon passes over earth 's shadow
The a full moon passes over earth 's shadow
A full Moon moves through Earths shadow
When the Moon passes through Earth 's penumbra , it is a penumbral eclipse , and since Earth 's shadow is large , a lunar eclipse lasts for hours
Only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbr

Because a faster wind hits ocean directly
The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast , over how great a distance , and how long the wind blows
Because the faster wind speed will cause the wave to be larger than a slower wind speed
Because a faster wind lasts longer
It increases the amplitude of the wave

An astronaut weighs more and has the same mass on the moon

Weight depends on mass
Mass is needed for the pull of gravity
There are no similarities between mass and weight
They are closely related
More mass is pulled by gravity with greater force ; mass and weight are closely related but the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes

More mass is pulled by gravity with greater force ; mass and weight are closely related but the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes
The force of gravity is different between the Earth and the moon
The moon is smaller than Earth
Because the mass changes on Moon but does not change on Earth
The force of gravity is the same in all places of the Earth , however it is different from the gravitation force on the moon
Because the pull of gravity is same everywhere on Earth but changes when on the Moon

Zinni lied
Both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long - term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia

The AC-130 might cause more collateral damage than the cruise missiles
Zinni lied
Both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long - term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia . The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft 's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles
